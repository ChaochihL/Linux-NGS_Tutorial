# UNIX/Linux Tutorial 
This is a tutorial for basic UNIX/Linux commands commonly used in computing for next generation biology. This tutorial is adapted from the [Linux Tutorial](http://manuals.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/home/linux-basics) by Jordan Hayes, Grant Brady and Thomas Girke from UC Riverside. I have pulled out parts from Thomas Girke's tutorial that I believe are applicable to computing for next generation biology and added additional parts not in Thomas Girke's tutorial that I frequently use on a day to day basis. 

This tutorial is meant for those without any experience working in a UNIX/Linux environment but can also be used as a reference for those with some experience working in the environment. 

The tutorial has two parts: 
- [Lecture 1](https://github.com/liux1299/Linux-NGS_Tutorial/blob/master/Lec1_UNIX-Linux_Basics.md) will cover basic UNIX/Linux commands. For the slides version go to https://swipe.to/3471s.
- [Lecture 2](https://github.com/liux1299/Linux-NGS_Tutorial/blob/master/Lec2_Computing_for_Next_Gen_Biology.md) will cover computing for next generation biology. For the slides version go to https://swipe.to/2607v.

**This is a hands-on tutorial so grab your computers and get ready to jump in!**

Feel free to make suggestions on improvements for this tutorial!
